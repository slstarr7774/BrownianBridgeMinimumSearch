# BrownianBridgeMinimumSearch
Python codes for doing a Brownian Bridge Minimum Search
See the corresponding paper on the arXiv: Online minimum search for a Brownian bridge by Erik Wu and Shannon Starr.
Both codes have Certificate 1 and Certificate 2 implemented.
BrwnBrdgMnSrch1 just uses Certificate 2 to "quit", as it does for Certificate 1.
BrwnBrdgMnSrch2 instead shows all the m-values: if any in the first or fourth subinterval is less than 0, then Certificate is a red-X.
